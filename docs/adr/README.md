# Architecture Decision Records

Load-bearing decisions that govern how DesignJS is built. Each ADR describes the context, the decision, and the consequences at the time it was made. Later realities go into an **Addendum** at the bottom of the same file; the original body is not rewritten — the history of how the decision aged is part of the record.

When a decision is genuinely reversed, write a new ADR that supersedes the old one and link both ways.

## Index

The **Implementation** column lists the commit(s) that landed each ADR. For ADRs with long implementation chains, only the load-bearing commits are listed inline; the full set lives in each ADR's *Addendum* section.

## Adding a new ADR

1. Copy the shape of an existing file (Status / Date / Owner / Related / Context / Decision / Consequences / Open questions).
2. Start with **Status: Proposed**. Flip to **Accepted** once code starts landing against it.
3. **Add an Implementation entry to the Index above** when the first commit lands. Update the entry as more commits ship; if the chain gets long, fold the long-tail into the ADR's Addendum and keep only load-bearing hashes in the Index row.
4. If an accepted ADR's reality diverges from the original text, append an **Addendum** section dated, signed, and describing what changed — don't rewrite the body.
5. If a decision is genuinely reversed, write a new ADR that supersedes the old one. Link both ways: the new ADR's `Supersedes` block, and the old ADR's `Status` updated to `Superseded by ADR-NNNN`.
6. Reference the ADR from [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) if it shapes contributor expectations.

## Why ADRs aren't moved or archived

ADRs are an immutable historical record. Moving an Accepted ADR into a `completed/` subdirectory would break commit-message cross-references (e.g. `commit b5fa664` references `0004-frames-in-layer-tree.md` at its current path), in-ADR cross-links (`Supersedes` / `Related` blocks), and the convention that an ADR's path is its permanent ID. ADRs don't "complete" the way stories do — the *implementation* completes; the ADR records the decision. The Index above is the index of "where each one is in its lifecycle."
